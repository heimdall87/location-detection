Cinnamon Location
=================

This Cinnamon applet displays the geographic location of your public IP address.

My public IP changes somewhat regularily, so I like to have a quick reference as to "where I am".

####Install

`cd` to `~/.local/share/cinnamon/applets/` and `git clone https://github.com/mindcruzer/cinnamon-location.git cinnamon-location@mindcruzer.com`.

Now add the applet to your panel like you would any other.

####Be a bro

My API key for [IPInfoDB](http://ipinfodb.com/) is in `applet.js` in `GEO_IP_URL`. If you're going to actually use this, be a bro and 
[sign up for your own](http://ipinfodb.com/register.php)? Only takes a second.
