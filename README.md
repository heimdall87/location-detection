Cinnamon Location
=================

![](http://s14.directupload.net/images/140818/ftp65kfo.png)

This Cinnamon applet displays the geographic location of your public IP address.

###Install

```shell
cd ~/.local/share/cinnamon/applets/
git clone https://github.com/mindcruzer/cinnamon-location.git cinnamon-location@mindcruzer.com
```

###API Key

The API key for [IPInfoDB](http://ipinfodb.com/) is in `applet.js` in `GEO_IP_URL`. If you're going to actually 
use this, I would be cool if you'd [sign up for your own](http://ipinfodb.com/register.php). It only takes a second.
